# diffusers-containers
Working with HuggingFace diffusers, Docker containers, and Git with SSH thru the command line. 

Based on a FourthBrain demo I saw, using this: https://github.com/FourthBrain/Branching-out-of-the-Notebook

In a nutshell, we watched in awe as dude juggled code, data, and models with hard-core Git CLI commands, 
thru SSH, and in a few minutes had a totally awesome thing up, running, and being monkeyed with, 
in a simple Docker container.

FourthBrain showed us all the parts in an earlier demo. This one, they made the parts sing.

I'm just here to learn to do that.
